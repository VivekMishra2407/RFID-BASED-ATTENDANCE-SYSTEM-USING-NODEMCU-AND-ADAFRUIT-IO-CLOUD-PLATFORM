# RFID-BASED-ATTENDANCE-SYSTEM-USING-NODEMCU-AND-ADAFRUIT-IO-CLOUD-PLATFORM
The traditional pen-paper based attendance is very time consuming, insecure and causes human errors as well as can cause misconduct. Hence to overcome this problem, a real time iot enabled rfid based attendance system has been developed in order to represent the data in the form of unique rfid cards and tags which are easily scannable on the rfid scanner. The system implemented consists of hardware as well as software with the implementation of MQTT protocol which is a lightweight, small in size, public subscribe network protocol that transports messages between devices using ESP8266 Nodemcu and Adafruit io cloud platform. The main objective of this system is to make efficient computerized based attendance system, details of which can be accessed any time from any place using the cloud platform.
